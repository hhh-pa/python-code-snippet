# python-code-snippet

## Introduction

This repository is a curated collection of commonly used algorithms, aimed at reinforcing a software engineer's general algorithmic knowledge. Each snippet is implemented in a minimal and accessible manner, focusing on clarity of logic and optimal time/space complexity rather than production-readiness.

This repository is the Python port of the collection (see [cpp-code-snippets](https://github.com/m-hu/cpp-code-snippets), [clojure-code-snippet](https://github.com/hhh-pa/clojure-code-snippet), and [ocaml-code-snippet](https://github.com/hhh-pa/ocaml-code-snippet)). Solutions mirror the other snippet repos: one standalone script per problem under `src/<area>/<problem>.py` (or `src/<area>/<problem>/<stem>.py`), executed directly via `python3 <script>` (stdin in, stdout out).

### Scope

The repository intentionally excludes production-level concerns such as:

- Memory management
- Error handling
- Vulnerability mitigation

These aspects, while important in real-world applications, are intentionally left out to keep the focus on core algorithmic logic. The assumption is that the intended viewers are primarily interested in the conceptual content itself, rather than scrutinizing the code for potential attack surfaces or production-level robustness.

### Privacy & Exposure

Some code examples have been moved to a **private repository** as a precautionary measure to limit exposure and reduce potential risk, especially when the repository is accessed in contexts where the intent of the viewer is uncertain.

### Test Cases

To respect the rights of original content creators, **test cases are not included** in this repository in plain form. Instead, they can be found on the websites where the referenced problems originate.

For automated validation, the shared test cases from the recipes superproject (`resource/shared`) ship as an encrypted bundle, `tests/resources.tar.xz.asc` (tar.xz, AES-256, ASCII-armored). All testing and measuring tools are written in Go under `scripts/ci/go` (compiled into a single cached `snip` binary). `snip test` runs every `src/**/*.py` script against the decrypted cases and diff-compares stdout against the expected output (trailing whitespace per line ignored).

### CI/CD Pipeline

`.github/workflows/test.yml` validates the snippets on push to `master`, pull requests, and manual dispatch. It decrypts the bundle with the `RESOURCES_PASSPHRASE` organization secret (shared with the clojure/ocaml snippet repos) and runs a full-matrix sweep: `snip measure --repeat 1` executes every `src/**/*.py` script against the decrypted cases, diff-gating stdout exactly like `snip test` (same command, same timeout, missing resources fail), while recording CPU/wall time and peak RSS from wait4 rusage. One run per branch supersedes the previous commit's run (master keeps every run); snippets split across 8 cohesive shards.

The `test` job keeps only the harness checks (`go test ./...` plus `snip measure --self-test`), which the sweep does not run. The sweep defaults to timed-only; manual dispatch offers two inputs: `instrument` (`none`, `callgrind`, `pin`, `both`) adds instrumentation phases, and `compare` (default false) measures a from-tree and a to-tree instead — the PR base vs HEAD when the dispatched branch heads an open PR, otherwise the previous commit vs HEAD — with the report job publishing a from/to delta table (`snip compare`, informational only).

To test locally, decrypt the bundle into `tests/resources/` (passphrase holders only):

```sh
mkdir -p tests/resources
gpg --batch --yes --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase "$RESOURCES_PASSPHRASE" \
  -d tests/resources.tar.xz.asc | tar -xJ -C tests/resources --strip-components=1
snip test --resources tests/resources --jobs 4 --timeout 300
```

Rebuild the bundle after resource changes with:

```sh
snip bundle <resource/shared dir> [passphrase-file]
```

See `snip bundle --help` for rotation instructions when using a fresh passphrase.

## Performance Tracking (Pin)

`snip measure --pin` measures load-independent algorithmic complexity using Intel Pin 4.4 with a vendored inscount tool (`scripts/ci/instrumentation/`). Each case is measured once under Pin, with an `LD_PRELOAD` allocation-counting shim in the same run, yielding two signals:

- `pin_instructions` (executed application instructions) — completely load-invariant and deterministic across runs and runners sharing one Pin version.
- `allocated_bytes` (cumulative libc allocation in the same Pin run) — the memory signal. It includes Pin's own JIT/VM allocations, so like `pin_instructions` it is only comparable within one Pin version.

`--repeat 0` selects this pin-only mode: no timed phase runs, correctness is still gated on the Pin run's stdout, and reports carry `Runs: 0` with no time summaries (the BMF and summary table omit `cpu_time` rather than emitting zeros).

CPU time and peak RSS come from the timed sweep phase (single uninstrumented execution per case). Under instrumentation the figures describe the tool process: Pin's footprint dominates RSS, and Callgrind inflates CPU — so pin-only reports carry no time/memory summaries, while Callgrind CPU/RSS include tool overhead.

```sh
snip pin-provision  # one-time Pin 4.4 kit + tool provisioning
snip measure --resources tests/resources --repeat 0 \
  --pin --pin-bin "$INSTRUMENTATION_BIN" --pin-tool "$INSTRUMENTATION_TOOL" \
  --output perf.json --bmf-output bencher.json
snip measure --self-test
```

CI sweeps always run timed (`--repeat 1`); dispatches add instrumentation via `instrument`: `pin` provisions Pin 4.4 (kit + built tool cached across runs) and records instruction counts plus allocated bytes alongside the timed phase, `callgrind` installs valgrind and records Callgrind `Ir`, and `both` runs all phases. Nothing reports to Bencher (repeat-1 timing is not a threshold signal); stats live in the per-shard artifacts and the merged summary tables. With `compare` ticked, each shard job also measures a from-tree (PR base, else previous commit) and the report job publishes a from/to delta table.

Note: Pin counts and Callgrind Ir are different signals on different scales. `--repeat 0` (pin-only, no timed phase) stays available for local runs; CI always includes the timed phase.
